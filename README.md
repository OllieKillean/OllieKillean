### Hey, I'm Ollie.
I'm a software developer from the United Kingdom who works on a few projects from time-to-time. Here's some stuff I work on:

- [BirbJS/Birb](https://github.com/BirbJS/Birb): A Discord API wrapper written in TypeScript
- [Chargeless/crypit](https://github.com/Chargeless/crypit): A cryptographic, unique identifier and randomness generator written in TypeScript
