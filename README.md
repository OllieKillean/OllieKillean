### Hey, I'm Ollie.
I'm a software developer from the United Kingdom who works on a few projects from time-to-time. Currently I'm working on:

- [BirbJS/Birb](https://github.com/BirbJS/Birb): A Discord API wrapper written in TypeScript

Founder and Chief Executive at [Chargeless](https://chargeless.io), a software billing startup based around helping startups and scaleups grow without having to worry about billing. *Currently not open to offers, but I'd still love to have a chat: [email me](mailto:ollie@chargeless.io).*
